            <p>Weekends are a great time for personal achievements outside of work.
Like writing a kernel. Or discovering a new radioactive element. Or
writing a poem. Or, as in my case, getting a haircut.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanted to try this new place. It seemed to have a good ambiance, and
    its staff wore uniforms. Sure they spelled "Gents" with a J, but I
    am not expecting them to have a PhD in English anyway.</li>
<li>The place was full. 6 people were waiting. "10 minutes, sir" said
    the barber and beckoned me inside. I walked in thinking this guy at
    least had a sense of humour.</li>
<li>The customers seemed to be spending a lot of time on the chair. One
    guy in particular, got a haircut, a shave, an oil massage, a face
    massage and a facial done to him. I wondered whether this guy had a
    rich uncle who had recently died.</li>
<li>Also wondered whether all these people were here because it was
    close to salary day. As if reading my thoughts, all  the customers
    started singing in that annoying Dairy Milk tune, "baal hai katana
    aaj pehli tareek hai!" with the barbers conducting the song with
    their comb and scissors. Damn it. I was hallucinating again.</li>
<li>The staff ordered tea and offered it to all the waiting customers.
    Touched as I was with this unprecedented act of courtesy, I politely
    said no, owing to the fact that the floor was full of other people's
    hair and the fan was on full blast.</li>
<li>After an hour, my turn finally came. I turned to the other waiting
    customers, laughed maniacally and said, "Ha! Take that you losers!".
    But not out loud.</li>
<li>Meanwhile the guy with the dead rich uncle was getting his
    face steamed. What a girl.</li>
<li>Took the chair and looked at my face in the mirror and thought that
    my hair was really not that long. Should have let it grow for a
    week longer. Oh well, too late now.</li>
<li>During the water spray, a drop of water landed on my nose and it
    started twitching.  The barber noticed this and grabbed a tissue and
    wiped my entire face. I was overcome with emotion at his
    thoughtfulness, but held back the tears as I didn't want to trouble
    the great man again.</li>
<li>Very talented guy he was. With just a few snips, he made my hair
    look really really good. Even my parents would agree later that I
    looked almost human.</li>
<li>Came home and blogged about it, all the while vaguely wondering why
    anyone would want to read this nonsense.</li>
