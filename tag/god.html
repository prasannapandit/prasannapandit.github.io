convey it. Of course, it wasn't the first time he was breaking a bad
news. He had done it many times before. But not a news this bad. Not
that he was afraid. He had nothing to fear from The Creator. After all,
the Creator had helped them tide many such difficulties before. And yet,
the helper wondered whether He would be able to do it this time. The
Creator had immense powers, no doubt, but the helper knew He never
interfered in someone's fate. Not even His own.</p>
<p>"My Lord", the helper began, but the Creator cut him off. "How close are
they?", He asked.</p>
<p>"Very close, My Lord. It's only a matter of hours now. And then, they
will know everything."</p>
<p>The Creator did not reply. There was no sign of any emotion in His face.
The Creator rarely showed emotion, but even if He was disturbed ever so
slightly at the devastating news, He did not betray it.</p>
<p>"They will know everything, My Lord", the helper went on, " the secrets
of all your creations. The beginning of the Universe. The origin of all
life. The reason for their existence. Even the future. They'll be able
to predict their future without a doubt!"</p>
<p>"Yes. So they will", replied the Creator.</p>
<p>"But how did all this happen, My Lord? How did they come so close to
finding out? You did not create the universe that way, My Lord,
certainly not the way they will say you did!"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't. But does it matter? All those equations are just their
way of interpreting my creations. Interpretations do not matter. Truth
does." The helper tried to argue, but the Creator went on, "You see, the
reason all this happened is because I created the human mind this way. I
gave them the power to think. To reason. To imagine. To believe in my
creations. To believe in me. Most of all, to believe in themselves. And
it is this creation of mine that will bring about our end."</p>
<p>The helper gasped. "Our end? Surely not, My Lord?"</p>
<p>"What do you think will happen when all of the world's mysteries are
solved? When all of the world's secrets are discovered? When everyone
knows exactly what is going to happen in the next second? When they
finally understand why something happens the way it does? Do you think
people will see My hand in things anymore? Do you think anyone will
believe in My existence anymore?"</p>
<p>The helper seemed to be searching for a way to counter this. "But My
Lord, how does it matter what people believe?"</p>
<p>"It matters a lot more than you think. It is time I told you something I
have never told you before. You think I created them? Has it ever
occurred to you that it is them that created Me? That it was their
belief in Me that made My existence possible? That it was their
inability to explain the mysteries of the universe and their insecurity
about their future that made Me possible? That we are just a result of
their imagination? That when I say I created something, it is in fact,
all in their beliefs that I created it? That we are only as real as they
believe us to be?"</p>
<p>"My Lord!", the helper cried, " how can we be not real? We.. we..
exist!"</p>
<p>The Creator gave him a kind look. "But my dear helper, how would <em>you</em>
know if you were indeed just an imagination?"</p>
<p>A distant cry of triumph reached their ears. The Creator and his helper
watched from far away as a young scientist screamed and danced in
celebration. They watched him soak in the joy of being the first to
discover the truth. They watched as he rushed to announce his discovery.
They watched as he, in his excitement tripped over a loose carpet and
tumbled down the staircase. They watched as he fell, head first, onto
the floor. They watched as he lay, his neck bent at an impossible angle,
clearly dead, with the joy on his face still clearly visible, though now
mingled with expressions of horror. Whether the horror was of his own
sudden death, or of the loss of the precious knowledge present only
within him, they couldn't tell.</p>
<p>A shadow of a smile appeared on the Creator's face. "We live another
day", He said.</p>                </article>
