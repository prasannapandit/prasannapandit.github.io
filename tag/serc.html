before this.)</p>
<p>Two opportunities down. Sigh.</p>
<p>Early morning on the 12th, I was on the Shatabdi train that would take
me out of Kanpur to Delhi. The previous day, when booking my ticket, I
had requested the reservation lady for a window seat, so that I could
avoid making unnecessary eye-contact with people and have a nice corner
to myself. To my horror, I found that the lady had not only ignored my
request, but had also given me an aisle seat right below an AC vent,
exactly in the middle of the coach, facing half the passengers of the
coach, who kept looking at me curiously as I slowly froze to death. I
quickly buried my face into the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=57UIPoLt3tkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=computer%20architecture%3A%20a%20quantitative%20approach&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computer
Architecture</a>
book, imagining bad things happening to reservation lady. The train
staff soon brought a bunch of free newspapers for us to choose from.
Since I had paid Rs. 3.50 for my Times of India ten minutes back on the
railway platform, I asked for an Indian Express instead, mostly just to
wipe my tears with it. The food service was excellent, and my attempts
to study were frequently interrupted by the staff bringing me something
to eat. By the time I got off the train, I was reasonably well-fed, had
seen the Supreme Court dome from the train window and read the same
paragraph twelve times.</p>
<p>After the blazing overhead sun thawed me a little, I proceeded to take a
prepaid auto to IIT campus. En route, I saw the India Gate and the
residences of Sharad Pawar, Ram Vilas Paswan and Shiela Dixit on
Janpath. My attempts to see 10 Janpath (Sonia Gandhi's residence) were
thwarted by a truck that blocked my view. Pretty soon I had reached the
Karakoram hostel of <a href="http://www.iitd.ac.in/">IITD</a>.</p>
<p>At the Karakoram hostel, I encountered some of the most irresponsible
people I have ever met. On reaching the hostel office, I was given a
bank slip and asked to pay the rent at SBI at the rate of Rs. 140 per
day. After standing in the queue for an hour and watching a super-slow
cashier age visibly by the time my turn came, I went back to the hostel
office only to be told that they were out for lunch. I went back at 3 o'
clock, and the staff pushed me away and told me to come at 5 o' clock.
Finally at five, I was told that there are no rooms available and that I
should sleep in the common room! Tired as I was walking in the hot sun
all day in my formal shoes, I completely flipped out and yelled at them
politely for five minutes. However I deny that I called them
"irresponsible imbeciles", but that could be because I did not know the
correct translation in Hindi. Finally, I was asked to "adjust" in the
common room for one night and that they would give me a room the next
day. Thankfully, I met an SJCE senior in IITD campus, who most kindly
accommodated me in his room. He also showed me around the campus. The
campus was small and had lots of multi-storeyed buildings. I also had
the opportunity of meeting a couple of guys from the Navy and the
conversation was very interesting.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.iitd.ac.in/deptt/ee/">Electrical Department</a> interview
the next day went very well. I was asked mostly text book questions on
Computer Architecture and Operating Systems, and ten minutes later, I
came out with the feeling that I may have just secured my first admit.
However my CS admit was still stuck in waiting list and the correct
picture would only be clear two days later. I had my ticket to Bangalore
that evening, and I decided not to cancel it. I would come back to Delhi
on 17th if necessary (Don't judge me, people! I was earning!). As I came
to understand, interview for wait-listed candidates was only a
formality.</p>
<p>One last thing needed to be done. I had paid the stupid hostel guys for
four days of accommodation, so I went there asking them to allot me a
room without any payment if I came back on 17th.</p>
<p><strong>Hostel Guy:</strong> What? No no. We can't do that. Go away.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>HG:</strong> Because we have already written the date on your receipt. We
can't do anything once it's written. Go away.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Eh? But you never gave me a room on that date.</p>
<p><strong>HG:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong></p>
<p><strong>HG:</strong> Uhh, I'll ask my boss.</p>
<p>The senior guy angrily said that no alterations could be done on such
solid legal devices as hand-written receipts, and that I was blaming
them unnecessarily. I then calmly gave a long speech, the gist of which
was, "Sir, I am not blaming you. I'm just saying it's all your fault",
after which he was convinced (confused?) and agreed to give me a room
with no additional payment if I swore I would not eat their hostel food.
I had no problems with that.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.spicejet.com/">SpiceJet</a> flight to Bangalore was three
hours late, so I hung around IITD campus for a little longer and left in
the evening. The departure terminal of the Delhi airport was bigger and
had lots of shops compared to Bangalore. I had more than a couple of
hours before my flight, so I whiled away my time doing some window
shopping. The most interesting thing I saw at the airport was a drinking
water fountain which I tried to use and twisted my neck badly. I backed
away quickly before I made a bigger fool of myself.</p>
<p>After a delay of almost three and a half hours, I was finally on the
flight. The captain was remarkably honest, and said the delay was
because of "late arrival of aircraft". The initial journey was far from
smooth, and the aircraft shook and dipped alarmingly a few times. I
smartly guessed that the cause was "turbulence". The guy next to me had
a different explanation. "Maybe a girl is driving it", he said and
laughed at his own joke. I pretended to laugh with him, but secretly
added "sexist strangers on airplanes" to the categories of people who
annoy me. A few minutes later the seatbelt sign was off, and the captain
explained that there had been turbulence shortly after takeoff (see?).
Halfway through the journey, the pilot announced that we could see the
city of Bhopal on the left. I concluded that the pilot was telling the
truth, because I was sitting on the right side and there was certainly
no Bhopal there! We landed in Bangalore at about midnight.</p>
<p>Next day, <a href="http://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a> put up its list of
selected students for MTech in Computer Science and I had made it. Just
like that. Direct admission. Total anti-climax. It was like watching
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother">How I Met Your
Mother</a> for ten
seasons, only to find out that there WAS no mother and that the kids
were adopted. Still, it was a welcome anti-climax. My acceptance along
with original GATE scorecard was supposed to reach IITM in a week, so I
decided not to go back to Delhi. In retrospect, it wasn't the best
decision, because IITD probably offered more courses to my liking than
IITM. Still, I had to prepare for the MSc (Engg) interviews at IISc,
arguably the toughest in the PG admission circuit, and I needed time for
that.</p>
<p>I got calls for MSc (Engg) from all places I applied in
<a href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/">IISc</a> -
<a href="http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in/">CSA</a>,
<a href="http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/">SERC</a> and
<a href="http://www.cedt.iisc.ernet.in">CEDT</a>. SERC and CEDT calls were on the
same day, same slot. But since I wasn't that interested in CEDT, I
didn't bother to reschedule either and just concentrated on getting
through the other two. My first interview was in CSA and the second in
SERC that same afternoon. The CSA test was simple enough with questions
on basic math and programming. The test was not used to shortlist
candidates, and all were interviewed anyway. The interview was not a
disaster, but it wasn't spectacular either. I struggled with algorithm
analysis and needed a lot of prodding from the panel to help me along. I
thought I did architecture decently, but overall, I doubted if my
performance was enough to see me through.</p>
<p>So, now only one call remained. SERC. Back to the same place with which
we started our story. As expected there was a small written test for
half an hour with questions on maths and programming. I got at least
four out of five correct and was not surprised when I was shortlisted
for the interview. However there were a lot of candidates before me, so
it was 7 o' clock in the evening when my turn finally came. And then,
over the next forty minutes, I gave the best interview of my life. The
panel recognized that I had come before and started off by asking
questions I had admitted to not having answered the last time. Somehow,
I was completely relaxed this time around. It was a very interesting
interview, with the panel wanting to know how I would analyze different
designs in architecture. In the end, I had answered/analyzed practically
every question asked of me, and knew I had a solid chance of getting
through this one. In fact, I was even asked why I was applying for
masters and not for direct PhD.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, the final results were announced. I had made
it. It was a long, tiring process, but it was worth going through. Since
research at IISc was consistent with why I wrote GATE in the first
place, I cancelled my admission at IITM and finished the initial
formalities at IISc. I also declined the admission offer for the
Electrical Department CT course at IITD.</p>
<p>Looking back at the whole thing, I feel I have been incredibly lucky.
There was a time, December-January I think, that I felt there was a
genuine chance that GATE this year would be a major disaster. Coming
from there to here has been quite unbelievable. True, I did screw up a
couple of opportunities, but everything went well when it mattered. Lots
of things could have gone wrong in those, but in the end, none of them
did.</p>
<p>And a thousand thanks to God for that.</p>
<p><strong>Epilogue:</strong></p>
<p>With all the joining day formalities done, I was finally a student of
IISc. But one thing remained. I had picked up an SBI form for opening a
bank account from where the joining process was going on, but did not
have all the required documents, so today I went to IISc with the filled
application form and marched into the Bank Manager's cabin and said, "I
want to open a Savings account". The Manager looked at me strangely and
said, "But you have an SBI form with you!"</p>
<p>That's when I realized I was inside Canara Bank.</p>
